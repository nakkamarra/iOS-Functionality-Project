# iOS-Functionality-Project
Nick Brandt

## Project Description
Using Apple's Swift language, this application will offer an exploration of some of Apple's iOS operating system's quintessential APIs, core libraries and fundemental device hardware capabilities. 

## Minimum Hardware Requirements
Some of the functionality within this project will access hardware features which are only available on the iPhone 7 or newer devices. Also, any device or simulator intended for testing may need to be running iOS 10.0 or a more recent version of the operating system.

## Goals
This project essentially focuses on the CPU usage and memory requirements of utilizing standard iOS device features. Along with using the ```UIKit``` module for handling the bulk of the user interface work, the various classes call upon a myriad of iOS APIs that are within the ```CoreMotion```, ```CoreLocation```, ```Foundation```, and ```Cocoa``` modules. The project will contain a central class, the ```MainDirectory``` class. This class is the intial view presented upon loading the application, and acts as a navigation center where a user can select a given ```UITableViewCell``` in a ```UITableView``` and navigate to one of four demonstrative classes: 

* __Gyroscope:__ this class implements methods to begin reading gyroscopic input and a method to stop reading said input. The rotation values in the [x,y,z] dimensions of the device will be outputted in real time to the user interface. This class also makes use of the built in animation engine that is part of ```UIKit``` to animate a simple green rectangular ```UIView```. The x and y rotation values are captured at a rate of 15Hz, and the values are used in a translation animation of the green rectangle, where the x and y values are multiplied by an offset of the rectangle's size in the 2D plane (e.g. x rotation is multiplied by half of the rectangle's width, y rotation is multiplied by half of the rectangle's height). The offset value generated by this operation increases with the intensity of the rotation of the device, so the larger the rotation values, the farther the rectangle will animate from its initial location. This class also displays the CPU and memory impact that these methods are having on the device in real time by using an instance of the SystemView.

* __Haptic Feedback:__ this class utilizes instances of the ```UIButton``` class for using the device's haptic feedback engine to generate vibrations on button press. There will be a button for each degree of intensity of haptic feedback. Each button intensity triggers an animated simulation of a collision between two ```UIView```s. The feedback occurs upon the views' collision to simulate the sense of physical collision. This class also displays the CPU and memory impact that a button press will have on the device in real time by using an instance of the SystemView.

* __Barometer:__ this class reads the device's barometer/altimeter and displays the input in real time to the user interface. Two ```UILabel```s will be used to display the output data from the ```CoreMotion``` Altimeter, and the readings for altitude measure two important changes: 
    * the relative altitude change since the start of the input stream
    * the measurement of current pressure upon the device, measured in kilopascals
Since the pressure exerted on the device in a normal situation should be around 1 atmosphere, the value for current pressure on an uninfluenced device should sit within the range of 101 - 102 kPa.

* __Accelerometer:__ this class implements methods for reading the device's accelerometer data and outputting the data in real time to the user interface. The ```CoreMotion```'s Accelerometer output measures the device's velocity as relative gravitational force along one of the device's axes. Changes in velocity in the [x,y,z] dimensions are measured as a function of the gravitational acceleration toward Earth, where the value 1.0 represents the standard _g_ value (9.8 m/s). For example, if the device were to be dropped from high up, the accelerometer would read the gravitational force of freefall as 1 along one of its axes. ```UILabel```s display these readings, which are accessed at a rate of 10Hz, by multiplying the accelerometer data values by _g_. This class also displays the CPU and memory impact that a button press will have on the device in real time by using an instance of the SystemView. 

* __Magnetometer:__ this class makes use of the device's built in magnetometer to display an estimation of which direction the top of the device is facing. The ```CoreMotion```'s Magnetometer output measures the [x,y,z] measurements of the device's magnetic field. Due to the fact that this data is raw data and does not account for the possible magnetic forces that move with or come from within the device, these values are not entirely precise. This class outputs the x, y, and z values to ```UILabel```s. Utilizing the ```CoreLocation``` module's ```CLHeading``` class, which utilizes a bias-compensated version of the ```CMMagnetometer``` class, the device's direction is also gathered in two forms. The first form is the device's direction in relation to magnetic true north, the second form is in relation to geographic true north. These are measured in degrees from 0 to 360, and this class will determine [N,S,E,W] depending on the range that these values sit within. This class also displays the CPU and memory impact that a button press will have on the device in real time by using an instance of the SystemView. 

* __SystemView__: this class is designed to be a subclass of the ```UIView``` class, and is strictly tasked with getting the device's CPU and memory usage at a given time. This is achieved by using pointers in conjunction with some of iOS's system calls for getting current task (process) information and currently running thread information. `reportMemory()` references the number of pages allocated to a given task, and calculates the resident memory for the task by seeing how much of the total memory in said number of pages is available. `reportCpu()` references the total number of threads that is currently running at a given time via the ```cpu_usage``` property values for each thread, and then divides that usage by the thread's scale factor, and sums the resulting value for each thread into a ```total_cpu``` variable. The SystemView will have two ```UILabel``` subviews which will be respectively updated each time these operating system values are referenced.

## Demonstration Clips
Here are some clips of an actual device being recorded using QuickTime to demonstrate each class. In each video, we can see that the UI and the functionality of each class requires more memory and some increased percentage of CPU from the device: 

![Gyroscope](/Demonstration Video Files/Gyroscope.mov "Observe the change in rotation in each axis as the device is rotated. The rotation can be roughly understood as the reverse effect of the green view's movement (device tilt away from user moves the view toward the user).")

![Haptic Feedback](/Demonstration Video Files/Haptic Feedback.mov "Although the vibration from the haptic feedback cannot be felt, this clip at least shows the animation differences between each intensity of haptic feedback.")

![Barometer](/Demonstration Video Files/Barometer.mov "Observe the change in relative altitude as the phone is raised above and then lowered below the original starting position. This clip also demonstrates the atmospheric pressure in kilopascals (1 ATM â‰ˆ 101 kPa).")

![Accelerometer](/Demonstration Video Files/Accelerometer.mov "Observe how, when the phone is held along some given axis, the gravitational constant can be seen as the velocity of the device in that dimension. This clip explores each axis in positive and negative (up and down).")

![Magnetometer](/Demonstration Video Files/Magnetometer.mov "Observe the slight difference between magnetic true north and geographic true north, as well as how the magnetic fields around the device are read in each dimension. This clip explores each of the 4 cardinal directions.")
